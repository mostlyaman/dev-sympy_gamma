# Developmental SymPy Gamma
[SymPy Gamma](https://sympygamma.com/) is a simple web application based on Google App Engine that executes and displays the results of SymPy expressions as well as additional related computations, in a fashion similar to that of Wolfram|Alpha.

Original SymPy Gamma Repository: [sympy/sympy_gamma](https://github.com/sympy/sympy_gamma)

This project recreates SymPy Gamma to run entirely in the browser using [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/)
